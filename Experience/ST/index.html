        <h1 class="topic">Senior Thesis Project</h1>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Description of Project:</h3>
        <p>My senior thesis project focused on solving a real-world problem reducing the repetitive nature of filling out job applications. The idea was to create a web extension that could autofill sections like basic information, work history, and education while offering guidance on essay questions and expected interview questions. The goal was to maximize the number of job applications while allowing users to focus on more personalized tasks, such as tailoring their resumes and building their professional network.</p>
        <p>The project involved building a browser extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I structured the extension to store user data using browser APIs like chrome.storage and built an intuitive user interface with features like navigation buttons and autofill functionalities. To further improve the user experience, I developed a feature that provides hard-coded outlines for common essay questions, simulating what an AI-based response might suggest.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Most Impactful Experience:</h3>
        <p>The most impactful experience during this project was the challenge of integrating AI-like features to assist users with interview and essay questions. I initially planned to use an AI-powered solution through the ChatGPT API, but it required a fee for each inquiry, which was not feasible at the time. Instead of abandoning the feature, I pivoted to a contingency plan hardcoding detailed outlines for commonly asked questions. This decision was a turning point, as it forced me to think creatively and focus on practical solutions. Successfully overcoming this challenge reinforced the importance of adaptability and problem-solving.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">What I Learned?</h3>
        <p>What I enjoyed most was the satisfaction of seeing my hard work translate into a functional tool that streamlined my own job application process. After countless iterations of trial and error, getting the extension to work as intended felt incredibly rewarding. It also gave me insight into how hiring processes can be optimized not just through automation, but also by focusing on networking and outreach. This experience left me excited to explore how I could extend the app to simplify networking and further enhance its value.</p>
