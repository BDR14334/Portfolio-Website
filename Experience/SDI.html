        <h1 class="topic">Software Development Internship</h1>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Description of Role:</h3>
        <p>At Hyatt Hotels Corporation, I worked as a Software Development Intern, gaining my first experience in web development using JSX/React. I was part of the team supporting one of their new brands, Caption by Hyatt. My primary role involved developing web components and addressing various tickets, including fixing styling issues, resolving code errors, and enhancing functionality. I also worked closely with version control tools like GitLab and participated in daily stand-up meetings to collaborate with cross-functional teams. This experience sharpened my technical skills and introduced me to a professional development environment.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Most Impactful Experience:</h3>
        <p>The most impactful experience was working on the group business pitch project, where my team developed an idea for an AI-based booking and virtual tour guide system. Presenting our concept to the companyâ€™s board of directors was an exciting challenge, and we ultimately secured second place out of five groups. Reflecting on the experience, I realized how important it is to avoid placing limitations on innovative ideas. While our project was solid, I believe we could have taken it further by thinking even bigger and pushing boundaries. This lesson taught me to embrace expansive thinking and always leave room for growth and new possibilities.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">What I Learned?</h3>
        <p>This internship taught me the value of initiative, collaboration, and continuous learning. I improved my technical skills in web development, particularly in JSX/React, and learned how to navigate a professional software development workflow using GitLab. Beyond technical growth, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of open-mindedness and creative thinking. The group project reinforced that success comes from pushing beyond perceived limits and presenting bold ideas, even if they seem ambitious at first. Overall, this experience solidified my passion for web development and left me excited to continue building innovative solutions in the future.</p>
