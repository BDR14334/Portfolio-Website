        <h1 class="topic">Residential Assistant</h1>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Description of Role:</h3>
        <p>As a Residential Assistant, I focused on building a welcoming and inclusive community for residents. I planned and facilitated monthly community-building programs such as game nights, study halls, and resourceful informal events. My role involved assisting residents with various needs, enforcing residential life policies, and fostering connections through active relationship-building and understanding. I conducted duty patrols to ensure safety and orderly conduct, monitored building maintenance, and created engaging bulletin boards to keep residents informed and connected. Additionally, I contributed to team meetings in support initiatives aimed at cultivating a prosperous and supportive residential community.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Most Impactful Experience:</h3>
        <p>The most impactful experience as a Residential Assistant was the positive feedback I received from my residents at the end of the year. Many shared how much fun they had and how I made their freshman experience more enjoyable and welcoming. They also pointed out the noticeable improvements in hall conditions during my time as their RA, such as addressing maintenance issues like low water temperatures in the showers, broken bathroom stall dividers, and damaged windows and hallway lights. My consistent efforts to report and follow up on these concerns helped create a well-structured and comfortable environment for everyone. Seeing these changes and knowing I contributed to improving their experience made the role truly rewarding.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">What I Learned?</h3>
        <p>This experience strengthened my leadership, planning, and conflict resolution skills, while teaching me how to manage diverse situations with empathy and professionalism. I learned the importance of building community partnerships and fostering meaningful relationships to create a positive and supportive environment. From organizing events to addressing resident concerns and coordinating with campus services, I developed strong crisis management and conflict resolution abilities. Peer mentorship became a central part of my role, allowing me to guide residents through both personal and academic challenges. Overall, being an RA taught me how to balance multiple responsibilities, think critically, and build a thriving community skills that will be invaluable in any future role.</p>
