        <h3 class="sub-heading">How I Started?</h3>
        <p>I first began cutting my own hair when I was in high school, but it wasn’t until I was in college and my barber/friend graduated that I started taking it seriously. He often joked about leaving and encouraged me to start cutting hair, so I did. Over the summer, I spent time developing my skills, which led to my cousin and friends offering to support me by letting me practice on them. When I got to campus, I began cutting hair for students and quickly built a network of 20-30+ clients. Word of mouth helped me expand, and I started refining my craft and style further, making it a trusted service on campus.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">It's Impact on my Life</h3>
        <p>This experience has had a lasting impact on my life, both personally and professionally. I learned invaluable lessons about relationship building, time management, and entrepreneurship. I also realized how effective digital marketing is in attracting more clients—by showcasing my skills through social media and offering referral discounts, I grew my client base. Mastering my craft allowed me to build a loyal following, and my ability to balance business and academics taught me essential time management skills. This experience shaped my understanding of how skills, combined with smart marketing, can lead to growth and success.</p>
