        <h3 class="sub-heading">How I Started?</h3>
        <p>My fitness journey has been an up-and-down battle, beginning at the age of five. I started with running track, and later, I played football, learning valuable lessons in discipline, resilience, and growth. However, in high school, I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, a condition that limited my physical growth and often made me sick. This diagnosis opened up new opportunities to focus on my health and rebuild my body. During this time, I also sustained two knee injuries in my junior year of high school, which was devastating, but I knew I had to overcome them. Nine months later, after undergoing tibial tubercle and ACL surgery, I was walking again.</p>
        <p>Although my mobility improved, I still struggled with weight, which sparked my passion for weightlifting. This newfound passion helped me achieve goals I once thought were impossible, and as I reached them, I became more motivated to help others achieve their fitness goals. I began creating workout plans for friends and family, encouraging them to push toward their own aspirations.</p>
        <p>After overcoming my knee injuries, I joined the college track team at Carthage, where I met a new group of people and gained invaluable experiences. The friendships I made and the lessons I learned in this new environment became some of the most rewarding aspects of my fitness journey.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">It's Impact on my Life</h3>
        <p>Today, I am the healthiest and fittest I’ve ever been, with improved muscle composition and stronger mental resilience. My fitness journey has taught me the importance of perseverance, faith, and patience understanding that with time and effort, I can achieve anything. It also shaped my outlook on life by helping me build mental strength and confidence, which I apply to other aspects of my life, including personal and professional growth.</p>
