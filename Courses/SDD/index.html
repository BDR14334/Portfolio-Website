        <h3 class="sub-heading">Description of Course:</h3>
        <p>Software Design and Development introduced me to the core concepts of software engineering, focusing on processes, methodologies, design techniques, and the essential tools used in the industry. This course prepared me to contribute to large-scale, sophisticated software projects as a professional software engineer. Key topics included software development processes, life cycle models, peer review practices, object-oriented design techniques, and modern testing strategies. Emphasis was placed on understanding the software development life cycle and mastering tools used in real-world development environments.</p>
    
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Most Impactful Project:</h3>
        <p>The group project was the highlight of this course, where we applied everything we learned in a collaborative environment. We worked as a team to develop a software application from concept to delivery, following an agile workflow. This involved gathering requirements, creating Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), designing Architecture Diagrams, developing User Stories, and writing comprehensive Test Cases. Regular peer reviews and feedback helped us refine our project, ensuring high-quality results. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication in software development.</p>
    
        <h3 class="sub-heading">What I Learned?</h3>
        <p>Throughout the course, I gained a deep understanding of software design and development processes. I learned how to document and manage software requirements, design system architectures, create user stories, and perform rigorous testing. Additionally, I became familiar with professional development tools and modern testing techniques, which are essential for delivering reliable and maintainable software. This course provided me with a solid foundation in software engineering, equipping me with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the field.</p>
