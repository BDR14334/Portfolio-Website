        <h1 class="topic">Computer Graphics (WebGL)</h1>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Description of Course:</h3>
        <p>Computer Graphics introduced me to the technical foundations of computer-generated imagery and visual programming. The course focused on essential topics such as linear algebra, geometry, color theory, human vision, and modern graphics programming using WebGL. It emphasized a project-driven approach, allowing me to apply these concepts through hands-on assignments to create real-time graphics and interactive 3D models.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Most Impactful Project:</h3>
        <p>The final project was the most impactful, where I recreated an image of interesting geometry using Three.js. I applied advanced lighting techniques beyond basic directional lighting, used various textures to enhance the realism, and took an artistic approach to ensure the model closely resembled the reference image. This project was a comprehensive culmination of everything I learned in the course.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">What I Learned?</h3>
        <p>Throughout the course, I gained a solid understanding of how graphics are rendered and manipulated in real time. I developed technical skills in Three.js and WebGL, improving my ability to work with 3D geometry, lighting, and textures. Additionally, this course taught me how to merge creativity with programming, fostering both technical expertise and artistic design skills.</p>
