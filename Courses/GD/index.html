        <h1 class="topic">Game Development II (C#)</h1>
    
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Description of Course:</h3>
        <p>Game Development II provided a deeper dive into game development, focusing on advanced C# programming and Unity game engine skills. The course emphasized hands-on experience in building a role-playing game (RPG) prototype, with each assignment designed to introduce a specific game development aspect. The flipped classroom model allowed me to engage with pre-recorded lectures and focus on practical application during in-class sessions.</p>
    
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Most Impactful Project:</h3>
        <p>The course was structured around five key assignments, each building on the previous one to create a cohesive RPG game. The first assignment focused on creating the player character and enemies, laying the foundation for the game’s core mechanics. Subsequent assignments included world-building, where I designed the game environment; player animation, where I implemented character movements and actions; player inventory, where I developed an interactive inventory system; and player dialogue, where I created dialogue interactions between characters. Each of these assignments played a crucial role in helping me build a well-rounded game.</p>
    
        <h3 class="sub-heading">What I Learned?</h3>
        <p>This course gave me a solid understanding of game development from the ground up. I became proficient in C# programming and learned how to utilize Unity’s tools effectively. I gained experience in structuring game projects, creating interactive environments, and managing character interactions. Additionally, the course improved my problem-solving and project management skills as I worked on progressively complex game systems. Overall, Game Development II reinforced my passion for game development and provided me with the skills to create well-designed, functional games.</p>
